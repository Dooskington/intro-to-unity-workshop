# Introduction to Unity Workshop

This is the sample project for the Introduction to Unity workshop I ran at UB on 4/1.
It's basically an empty project with a sample of what the final game will look like. It also includes a utility script, Audio.cs which makes it just a tid bit easier to play sound effects from a script.
